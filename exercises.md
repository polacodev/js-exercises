4. Reverse a String:
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of the string.
Input: "Hello"
Output: "olleH"

5. Palindrome Check:
Create a function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
Input: "radar"
Output: true

6. Anagram Check:
Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters in any order).
Input: "listen", "silent"
Output: true

7. Longest Word:
Write a function that finds the longest word in a sentence. For simplicity, you can assume that the input consists only of letters and spaces.

9. Capitalize Words:
Write a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a sentence.
Input: "capitalize the first letter"
Output: "Capitalize The First Letter"

10. String Compression:
Implement a function to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3".
Input: "aabcccccaaa"
Output: "a2b1c5a3"

11. Count Substrings:
Write a function that counts the number of occurrences of a substring in a given string.
Input: "ababab", "ab"
Output: 3

12. String Rotation:
Create a function to check if one string is a rotation of another. For example, "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat".
Input: "waterbottle", "erbottlewat"
Output: true

13. Remove Duplicates:
Implement a function to remove duplicate characters from a string without using additional data structures.
Input: "programming"
Output: "progamin"
